Exploring Authenticity and Truth in News
Examining the differences in narratives and website programming between unreliable and reliable news sources 

Here is an overview of each file in this repository

The two files used for my two techniques in my Final Year Project are
  Topic_Neighbourhood_Simularity.py 
  HTML_Classification.py 

These two files an incomplete naive bayes classification and a method to cluster news sources based on their topic neighbourhoods
  Bayes_Classification.py 
  Single_Topic_Clustering.py 

 
The singularity file was used to configure the supercomputer used during my HTML analysis, this file pulls on all the necessary resources to run my program

Tilte_Word_Freq.py returns the frequency of words just from the title alone

Here Topic_Neighbourhood_Simularity_Batch_Testing is used to automate testing on multiple topics and my utilities containing commonly used functions
  Topic_Neighbourhood_Simularity_Batch_Testing.py  
  Utilities.py
